#### Configuration Options 

consensus:
 1: WaterBear-C
 4: BEAT-Cobalt
 14: Waterbear-Q

RBC Type:
 0: RBC (WaterBear)
 1: AVID (WaterBear QS)

Notes on maliciousMode: This configuration denotes the experiments we conducted for the failure scenarios.
 0: 0--(f-1) are the malicious modes that always vote 0 in ABA
 1: (2f+1)--(3f) are the malicious nodes that always vote 0 in ABA
 2: malicious nodes don't propose RBC instance
 3: malicious nodes always vote the opposite value (XOR 1) in ABA

 Use different combinations of consensus and RBC Type to run different protocols


### Run the protocols: 

Use different combinations of consensus and RBC to run different protocols.
